# Accessible Digital Interactives

DIAGRAM Center's public library of code samples are provided here to be freely shared with everyone to help improve access for all when using these common templates.  The idea being developers, publishers, content creators could take these samples and incorporate them into their website or publication to make that control accessible to all.

Here is a link to the Demo Pages
